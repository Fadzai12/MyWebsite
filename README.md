On the 02/12/2017

I had difficulty with commiting:
Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   Thumbs.db
        new file:   mywebsite

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)

        modified:   mywebsite (modified content, untracked content)
